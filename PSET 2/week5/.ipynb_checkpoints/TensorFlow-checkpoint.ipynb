    "You've written a lot of code in this assignment to provide a whole host of neural network functionality. Dropout, Batch Norm, and 2D convolutions are some of the workhorses of deep learning in computer vision. You've also worked hard to make your code efficient and vectorized.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last part of this assignment, though, we're going to leave behind your beautiful codebase and instead migrate to one of two popular deep learning frameworks: in this instance, TensorFlow (or PyTorch, if you choose to work with that notebook)."

    "#### What is it?\n",
    "TensorFlow is a system for executing computational graphs over Tensor objects, with native support for performing backpropogation for its Variables. In it, we work with Tensors which are n-dimensional arrays analogous to the numpy ndarray.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our code will now run on GPUs! Much faster training. Writing your own modules to run on GPUs is beyond the scope of this class, unfortunately.\n",
    "* We want you to be ready to use one of these frameworks for your project so you can experiment more efficiently than if you were writing every feature you want to use by hand. \n",
    "* We want you to stand on the shoulders of giants! TensorFlow and PyTorch are both excellent frameworks that will make your lives a lot easier, and now that you understand their guts, you are free to use them :) \n",
    "* We want you to be exposed to the sort of deep learning code you might run into in academia or industry. "

    "# Part II: Barebones TensorFlow\n",
    "TensorFlow ships with various high-level APIs which make it very convenient to define and train neural networks; we will cover some of these constructs in Part III and Part IV of this notebook. In this section we will start by building a model with basic TensorFlow constructs to help you better understand what's going on under the hood of the higher-level APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Barebones Tensorflow\" is important to understanding the building blocks of TensorFlow, but much of it involves concepts from TensorFlow 1.x.** We will be working with legacy modules such as `tf.Variable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, please read and understand the differences between legacy (1.x) TF and the new (2.0) TF.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical background on TensorFlow 1.x\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow 1.x is primarily a framework for working with **static computational graphs**. Nodes in the computational graph are Tensors which will hold n-dimensional arrays when the graph is run; edges in the graph represent functions that will operate on Tensors when the graph is run to actually perform useful computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Tensorflow 2.0, we had to configure the graph into two phases. There are plenty of tutorials online that explain this two-step process. The process generally looks like the following for TF 1.x:\n",
    "1. **Build a computational graph that describes the computation that you want to perform**. This stage doesn't actually perform any computation; it just builds up a symbolic representation of your computation. This stage will typically define one or more `placeholder` objects that represent inputs to the computational graph.\n",
    "2. **Run the computational graph many times.** Each time the graph is run (e.g. for one gradient descent step) you will specify which parts of the graph you want to compute, and pass a `feed_dict` dictionary that will give concrete values to any `placeholder`s in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The new paradigm in Tensorflow 2.0\n",
    "Now, with Tensorflow 2.0, we can simply adopt a functional form that is more Pythonic and similar in spirit to PyTorch and direct Numpy operation. Instead of the 2-step paradigm with computation graphs, making it (among other things) easier to debug TF code. You can read more details at https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the TF 1.x and 2.0 approach is that the 2.0 approach doesn't make use of `tf.Session`, `tf.run`, `placeholder`, `feed_dict`. To get more details of what's different between the two version and how to convert between the two, check out the official migration guide: https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/migration_guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, in the rest of this notebook we'll focus on this new, simpler approach."

    "### TensorFlow warmup: Flatten Function\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see this in action by defining a simple `flatten` function that will reshape image data for use in a fully-connected network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, data for convolutional feature maps is typically stored in a Tensor of shape N x H x W x C where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- N is the number of datapoints (minibatch size)\n",
    "- H is the height of the feature map\n",
    "- W is the width of the feature map\n",
    "- C is the number of channels in the feature map\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the right way to represent the data when we are doing something like a 2D convolution, that needs spatial understanding of where the intermediate features are relative to each other. When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data.

    "\n",
    "In this section you can experiment with whatever ConvNet architecture you'd like on CIFAR-10.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should experiment with architectures, hyperparameters, loss functions, regularization, or anything else you can think of to train a model that achieves **at least 70%** accuracy on the **validation** set within 10 epochs. You can use the built-in train function, the `train_part34` function from above, or implement your own training loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe what you did at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some things you can try:\n",
    "- **Filter size**: Above we used 5x5 and 3x3; is this optimal?\n",
    "- **Number of filters**: Above we used 16 and 32 filters. Would more or fewer do better?\n",
    "- **Pooling**: We didn't use any pooling above. Would this improve the model?\n",
    "- **Normalization**: Would your model be improved with batch normalization, layer normalization, group normalization, or some other normalization strategy?\n",
    "- **Network architecture**: The ConvNet above has only three layers of trainable parameters. Would a deeper model do better? Good architectures to try include:\n",
    "    - [conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "    - [conv-relu-conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "    - [batchnorm-relu-conv]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "- **Global average pooling**: Instead of flattening after the final convolutional layer, would global average pooling do better? This strategy is used for example in Google's Inception network and in Residual Networks.\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Would some kind of regularization improve performance? Maybe weight decay or dropout?\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOTE: Batch Normalization / Dropout\n",
    "If you are using Batch Normalization and Dropout, remember to pass `is_training=True` if you use the `train_part34()` function. BatchNorm and Dropout layers have different behaviors at training and inference time. `training` is a specific keyword argument reserved for this purpose in any `tf.keras.Model`'s `call()` function. Read more about this here : https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization#methods\n",

    "\n",
    "### Tips for training\n",
    "For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind: \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n",
    "- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n",
    "- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n",
    "- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Going above and beyond\n",
    "If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n",
    "- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n",
    "- Model ensembles\n",
    "- Data augmentation\n",
    "- New Architectures\n",
    "  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n",
    "  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n",
