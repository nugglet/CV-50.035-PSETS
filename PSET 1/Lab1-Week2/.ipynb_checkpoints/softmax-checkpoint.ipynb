    "**Your answer:** lambda is the regularization term which penelizes the loss to prevent overfitting of the model. As lambda increases, the severity of the penalty increases, which minimizes the weights and thus reduces its impact on the resulting prediction. With a small lambda, the model's accuracy on the training set is much higher than the test set, which indicates overfitting. The model is unable to generalize well. As lambda increases, weights are penalized more and the model's ability to generalize improves. This is reflected by its accuracy on the test set increasing up until lambda 10^3. Naturally, it's accuracy on the training set reduces as a result. As lambda continues to increase, accuracy starts to drop, and at lambda values greater than 10^4, the model's accuracy drops drastically on both test and training sets, indicating underfitting."
